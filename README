Some of the Appsamuck example apps, written for Corona SDK and Lua

You can watch the Appsamuck examples apps in: http://www.appsamuck.com/

They are written in Objective-C for the iPhone. Very simple apps with source code provided, and the difficulty is increasing gradually each day. Perfect for learning new languages and frameworks, I think.

Corona Game Edition is a framework written in Lua, for iPhone and Android games development. You can check it out at:

And Lua is a great functional and scripting language I just want to try.

That's it. Have fun!
